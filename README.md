# 🚜 Machinery Demand Predictor

A data-driven machine learning solution that predicts the demand for construction machinery based on regional, political, marketing, and customer behavior factors.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was built as part of the **SRM Datathon 2025**, where participants were challenged to solve real-world business problems using machine learning.  
Our solution focuses on helping construction companies make informed inventory and sales decisions by forecasting machinery demand accurately.
